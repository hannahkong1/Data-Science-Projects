Like most datasets, this one will have missing values that we don't want to include in our analysis, therefore I will also be dropping missing values. Lastly, I will summarize the foundings of my analysis as well as the answers to my research questions. "

    "The findings of the analysis of this dataset would be extremely helpful to individuals who are trying to create new video games. This dataset aims to determine what makes a video game exceedingly succesful by recording data on different variables that could possibily be related to why a specific video game does better than another one in terms of sales. An individual could look at an analysis of this dataset and discover what components they need to configure into their game in order to make it popular. However, this analysis can also be helpful to those who are looking for new video games to play. They can look at the dataset and find which game best matches their interest by looking at the price variable, the variables that show what devices the game can be played on, the variables that show what type of game it is (adventure, educational, etc.), and more.

    "The dataset I have chosen to explore is the dataset on video games provided by the professor. In this dataset, there are many variables for each unit of observation which is one video game released between 2004-2010. Some important variables include the game name, its US Sales, publisher, used price, genre, and review score. These variables do a great job of being possible variables we could use to determine what makes a video game a blockbuster (ie. very succesful in sales). However, although it is a good dataset, there are still limitations on it. For example, the genre variable has alot of the same genres for every game, however, there are certain observations that have multiple genres in it. This would cause problems when analyzing the relationship between a game's genre and its US Sales because we wouldn't know which genre to put it in in order to analyze the relationship. This might lead to inaccurate results. Another limitation is that the people who collected the data didn't create a cheat sheet that tells you what the variables mean. So variables like block 4, block 2, block 1, and block 0.5 I am unsure as to what they mean and this might hinder my ability to analyze them. "

I would then use price and publisher as independent variables because I believe that the price of the video game will really influence how much people want to buy that game and therefore will influence that game's sales. For publisher, I know that alot of people only focus on the big brand name rather than the actual quality of the game, therefore I believe that the publisher of the video game will influence a game's US sales as well.

    "One limitation of my dataset is the fact that for the publisher variable, there are multiple publishers for one video game which makes it hard to analyze when I'm trying to determine the relationship between the publisher and the US Sales. Also there are multiple different publishers that are actually from the same company. For example, there is Nintendo but there are so many different values for it based on what country it's in. This makes it difficult to find the relationship between publisher and the US Sales because they're all the same company but it's split up into different countries. One variable that isn't already in this dataset that I would add is how many stores they're being sold in. Some video games are only sold in a specific video game store, or maybe others are sold at target, walmart, etc. so I think that would be a good variable to have so that we could compare exposure to US Sales.

    "This dataset does not have any missing values automatically detected by Python nor does it have any implicit missing values. Because of this, I will not be dropping any values. However if I did have missing values, I may or may not drop them. If it is the missing values are a substantial proportion of my data, I would consider not dropping them because this would greatly affect my data and analysis. If there are only a few missing values, I would drop them. The advantages of not dropping the missing values is that I am analyzing the dataset that was orginally inputted by the user, which might make my analysis slightly more accurate. A disadvantage of not dropping missing values is that I would be limited from doing certain analysis because some integer or float values might be nan instead of an actual number. If I did drop missing values, a disadvantage is that it could affect my analysis in case there are too many missing values in my dataset. An advantage would be that each variable would be the type that they're supposed to be. "

    "The cheapest used price for a video game is 4.95 dollars. This seems like an uncommon value in regards to the fact that most of the other prices of video games are around 20 dollars. There is also an uncommon price of 119.95 dollars. To me, this seems to be an inaccurate value because I can't think of any video game that could possibly sell for 120 dollars. There is also only one video game in the data set that has a used price of 120 dollars while the other games sell for 5-50 dollars. Because there is only one video game with a used price of 120 dollars, I am deciding to drop this value. This shouldn't hinder my analysis too much because it is only one row rather than a large amount of rows. However, dropping this one extreme value might limit future analysis because there is a chance that the game truly did sell for $119.95 and that there were reasons that were correlated with it, such as what type of game, how many player, etc. that could be used to determine what makes a video game succesful.

    "Based off all of the analysis I did above: group by to find the medians of US Sales for each publisher, a box plot showing the distribution of US Sales across the dataset, and the summary statistics of US Sales for all the video games in the dataset, I can see that larger US Sales might be correlated with big publishing names. In df_publisher, I grouped the US Sales in millions by each publisher that is included in the dataset. From the top 20 publishers with the highest US Sales, I can clearly see that 10 of these 20 (50%) are all Nintendo. Using outside knowledge, I know that Nintendo is a very popular video game publisher. Also in the box plot, most of the points that seem to stray away from the maximum value are from the games that are published by Nintendo. So from all this information, I am concluding that with a bigger publisher name, there is a chance that that specific game will get higher US Sales and have a larger change of being a blockbuster video game."

    "The video games dataset includes data on video games that were released between the years 2004-2010. The data collected on these video games consisted of a variety of variables that the data collectors believed would help them determine what it takes for a game to be a blockbuster video game (succesful in sales). Important variables include game name, US Sales, the publisher, used price, genre, and review score. These variables do a great job of helping us determine relationships between them and US Sales of a video game. Even though this is a good dataset, there are still limitations to it. The largest limitation I stumbled into was the fact that there were a lot of different branches of the same company that made it complicated for me to determine the relationship between the publisher and the US Sales. I couldn't just compare Nintendo to its mean US Sales, I had to compare each branch of Nintendo which made it more difficult and arguably less accurate. But, the good thing about this dataset is that it did not contain any missing values which saved me from the debate of whether or not it was the right situation to drop the missing values and rather or not it would hinder the results of my analysis in the future. I did have to drop one extreme value because its price was just way too much compared to the rest of the prices. I don't believe that this hindered my results too much because it was only one observation rather than a large amount. Other than that, there was no further data cleaning that I needed to do to my dataset. Lastly, from the summarizing data, I chose my research question to be \"What is the relationship between the publisher of the video game and its US Sales?\". After grouping by publishers and finding the mean of US Sales for each publisher, I came to the conclusion that video games that are published by larger and more popular publishers mostly earned more money in US Sales.

    "Like I said in the summarization above, one major limitation I had when trying to analyze my data was when I came across my research question. My research question was aimed to figure out how the publisher of a video game had an effect on that game's US Sales. This proved to be more difficult than I had originally thought because, to my surprise, there were many different publishers for one company. For example, Nintendo. It is one company but there were so many different branches that the data collectors combined together in different combinations. So if one game had 3 of the branches but another had 2 of the branches, they were considered to be 2 different publishers. I wish that all of the different branches of Nintendo was combined into one publisher so that it would be easier for me to find the relationship between the publisher and the US Sales. Before I make strong claims, I need to know what the targeted population is for this dataset because it only contains video games released in 2004-2010. So if the population were to be all video games, then I would say that a sample of video games released in a 6 year span is definitely not generalizable to the larger population. These limitations listed above might affect someone who is trying to find out how to make their game succesful because they will be confused on what publisher to sign with. They won't know which one because there are so many different branches of Nintendo and they are all combined differently for each video game. "

    "If I were to do future work on this analysis, I would focus on how the review score and used price affect the US Sales of a video game. These variables seem to not have much limitations to figuring out relationships. However, the publisher proved to have a lot of limitations so I wouldn't recommend doing further analysis on that. So I think some possible research questions would be: How does used price affect US Sales of a video game? and How does a higher review score affect US Sales? I also would not do further analysis regarding the genre of a video game and how it impacts the US Sale of that game because as stated in previous paragraphs, genre also proves to have a lot of limitations because some games have multiple genres which makes it confusing to determine what genre to place the game in when analyzing.
